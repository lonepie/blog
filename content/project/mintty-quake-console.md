### About 

This AutoHotkey script creates a system-wide hotkey for accessing the mintty terminal as a dropdown console, as popularized by the PC game, __Quake&trade;__.

I started development on this back in 2011, originally forking it from marcharding's 75-line [implemention](https://github.com/marcharding/mintty-quake-console). It has since grown to 620+ lines (and counting!).

Life events got in the way and I had to stop development on it for a number of years. However, with the release of Windows Subsystem for Linux and especially [wsltty](https://github.com/mintty/wsltty), I have resumed work on this project. I owe thanks to the members of the GitHub community that contributed bug fixes and features in my absence. Going forward, I plan to continue active development on this project. So please, report issues and feature requests through the project's GitHub page.
