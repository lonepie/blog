I'm glad that you asked! You see, back in the early days of online gaming, I used the handle, *Lone_Wolf*. It wasn't long until I found out that many other people were using that handle as well. I needed something unique. Pie happens to be one of my favourite things. The rest, as they say, is history.

### About me
- I have a decade of professional web development experience and a lifetime of general computer experience (I was practically raised by my computer).
- I like pie.
